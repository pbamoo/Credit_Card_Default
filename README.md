# Predicting Credit Card Default
   
### Background problem / Goal:
In this project, we are going to build a predictive model for The Taiwanese Financial Institution (TFI) in order to help the institution detect which customers will default on their credit card payment since they have been detecting an increase in defaults among their customers. 

### Tools/Libraries Used: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

### Workflow:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Inspection and exploration
3. Cleaning and preparation
4. Visualization
5. Modeling & Evaluation
6. Forecasting
7. Summary & Further Outlook
